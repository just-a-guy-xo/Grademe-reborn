Allowed functions: malloc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that takes a string, splits it into words separated by
whitespaces, and returns a NULL-terminated array with each word stored in a
freshly allocated string.

A "word" is a section of the string delimited by spaces, tabs or newline
characters. The returned array must be terminated by a NULL pointer.

Your function must be declared as follows:

char	**ft_split_whitespaces(char *str);

If memory allocation fails at any point, the function must return NULL. Empty
strings should result in an array containing only a NULL pointer.
