--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function ft_div_mod that takes two integers and two pointers to int (div
and mod) as parameters. The function should store the result of the integer
division of the two integers in the int pointed to by div. The remainder of the
division should be stored in the int pointed to by mod.

Your function must be declared as follows:

void	ft_div_mod(int a, int b, int *div, int *mod);

If b is equal to 0, the function should store 0 in both integers pointed to by
div and mod.

Example:

$> ./ft_div_mod 13 5 | cat -e
2 3$
