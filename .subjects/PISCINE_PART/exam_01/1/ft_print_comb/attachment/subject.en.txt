Write a function that displays all different combinations of three different
digits in ascending order, listed by ascending order.

Only the smallest combination of digits should be printed first. The numbers
must be separated by a comma followed by a space, except for the last
combination which should be followed by a newline.

Your function must be declared as follows:

void	ft_print_comb(void);

Example:

$> ./ft_print_comb | cat -e
012, 013, 014, ..., 789$
